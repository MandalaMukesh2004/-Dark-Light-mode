# Dark-Light mode
This project demonstrates a simple light/dark mode toggle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can switch between light and dark modes by clicking a button, which dynamically changes the background and text colors of the page.

Features
Light Mode: White background with black text.
Dark Mode: Black background with white text.
Toggle between modes by clicking the "CHANGE MODE" button.
How It Works
The project uses JavaScript to handle the switching logic between light and dark modes. The button click triggers a change in the background and text color, depending on the current mode. The mode is toggled each time the button is pressed, providing a seamless transition between light and dark themes.
